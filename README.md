# Quick-Naive-Bayes-Classifier
This is a part of my article at <a href= "https://theactivereader.medium.com/?source=home---------2---------------------c40960af_8c5a_44ca_96fb_32b14f8bf3e7-------2">Salam</a>, you can read the article from <a href="https://theactivereader.medium.com/working-with-evidence-bayes-theorem-9e58e6bab994">here</a><br>
This script gives a VERY basic step by step approach to use the Naive Bayes algorithm using the scikit-learn python library.<br>
The library includes a variety of classifiers depending on the distribution of your data.<br>
At the end of the script I just apply a prediction for each possible 'Evidence' class.<br>
