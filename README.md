# Quick-Naive-Bayes-Classifier
This is a part of my article at Salam, you can read the article from here:
This script gives a VERY basic step by step approach to use the Naive Bayes algorithm using the scikit-learn python library.
The library includes a variety of classifiers depending on the distribution of your data.
At the end of the script I just apply a prediction for each possible 'Evidence' class.
